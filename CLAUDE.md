# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## About this repo

Central, reusable GitHub Actions for `d-morrison` / `UCD-SERG` / `ucdavis` R-package
and Quarto repositories (see [`README.md`](README.md)). Each capability ships as a
composite action plus a `workflow_call` reusable workflow. Consumers pin to `@v1`.

### Layout

- Per-capability composite-action directories at the repo root, each with an
  `action.yml` and, for R/Python capabilities, a language-specific helper
  script — e.g. `check-bibliography-dois/` (R), `check-non-standard-chars/` and
  `check-phi/` (Python). `check-links/` bundles `lychee.default.toml`;
  `preview/`, `quarto-publish/`, and `open-sync-pr/` are action-only (the last
  is the shared push-and-open-PR helper used by `bump-submodule` and
  `sync-shared-fragments`).
- `.github/workflows/` — the `workflow_call` reusable workflows that wrap the
  composites (one per consumer-facing capability — the shared internal
  `open-sync-pr` composite has no wrapper), plus the `claude.yml` and
  `claude-code-review.yml` reusable wrappers, and `_selftest.yml`, which
  exercises composites on every PR — local `./` refs for pre-release
  capabilities, and `@v1` through the reusable-workflow wrappers for stable ones.
  `claude-bot.yml` and `claude-review.yml` are event-triggered workflows that run
  the Claude bot in this repo, not `workflow_call` wrappers.
- Several workflows have no corresponding root composite: `check-news.yml`,
  `summary.yml`, and `preview-deploy.yml` are `workflow_call` reusable workflows
  that wrap external actions; `cleanup-pr-previews.yml` is a self-contained
  `workflow_call` reusable workflow (inline shell logic, no external composite);
  `bump-submodule.yml` and `sync-shared-fragments.yml` are `workflow_call`
  reusable workflows that call the shared internal `open-sync-pr` composite;
  `slide-major-tag.yml` is push- and dispatch-triggered and runs only in this repo.
- `.github/actions/checkout-submodules/` — a small shared composite reused by the
  reusable workflows.
- `examples/` — caller stubs consumers copy into their own repos.
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — top-level project docs;
  `REVDEPS.md` — lists registered downstream consumer repos.

When editing a consumer-facing capability, change the composite (`<name>/action.yml`,
plus its helper script if one exists) and keep the wrapping reusable workflow and its
`examples/<name>.yml` stub in sync. Internal-only composites (like `open-sync-pr`)
have no wrapper or example stub to update. New `.github/workflows/` changes are
exercised by `_selftest.yml`; because brand-new actions aren't at the `@v1` tag
yet, the selftest runs them via the local `./<name>` ref until release.

### Tests

`check-phi/tests/test_detectors.py` is a pytest suite pinning each PHI detector's
positive and negative behavior. Run it with `python3 -m pytest check-phi/tests/ -q`;
CI runs it as the `phi-tests` job in `_selftest.yml`. There's no broader unit-test
harness — most capabilities are validated end-to-end by `_selftest.yml`, running
against this repo itself or small throwaway fixtures (stable capabilities via
`@v1`, pre-release ones from local source).

## GitHub access in remote / web sessions

Claude Code on the web (and other remote/CI sessions) runs in a sandbox where the
`gh` and `glab` CLIs are **not installed** and there is no direct GitHub API
access. Skills and built-in commands that tell you to "use `gh`" — `/review`,
`/code-review --comment`, `/security-review`, `/verify`, PR babysitting, PR
creation — only work if their GitHub steps are translated to the GitHub MCP tools
(`mcp__github__*`). When a skill or command instructs a `gh`/`glab` command in
such a session, substitute the equivalent MCP tool below. (In a local session
where `gh` is on `PATH`, use `gh` as the skill describes.)

This repo is `d-morrison/gha`, so MCP calls use `owner: d-morrison`, `repo: gha`.

| Operation / `gh`/`glab` command | GitHub MCP equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| `gh pr list` | `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` |
| `gh pr view <n>` | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get`) |
| `gh pr diff <n>` | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_diff`) |
| changed files in a PR | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_files`) |
| `gh pr status` / `gh pr checks` | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_status` / `get_check_runs`) |
| `gh pr create` | `mcp__github__create_pull_request` |
| read PR conversation comments | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_comments`) |
| read inline review comments | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_review_comments`) — also returns `threadId`s |
| post a top-level PR comment | `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` |
| post inline review comments | `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (`method: create`, no `event`) → `mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review` per comment → `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (`method: submit_pending`) |
| reply to a review comment | `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment` |
| approve / request changes | `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (`method: create` with `event`) |
| resolve a review thread | `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (`method: resolve_thread`, `threadId: <id from get_review_comments>`) |
| `gh issue list` / `gh issue view <n>` | `mcp__github__list_issues` / `mcp__github__issue_read` |
| read a file / repo contents | `mcp__github__get_file_contents` |
| CI runs & job logs | `mcp__github__actions_list`, `mcp__github__actions_get`, `mcp__github__get_job_logs` |
| watch / stop watching PR activity | `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity` / `mcp__github__unsubscribe_pr_activity` |
| `glab mr ...` (GitLab) | N/A — this repo is on GitHub; use the tools above |

Posting inline comments requires a **pending review to already exist** before
`mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review`; create the pending review first, add
each comment, then submit once at the end. Watch and respond to PR activity with
`mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity` / `mcp__github__unsubscribe_pr_activity` (not
`gh pr checks --watch`).

### Reading repos outside the session's MCP scope

A task often needs files from a *sibling* repo (e.g. `d-morrison/qwt`) that the
session's GitHub MCP tools aren't scoped to — those calls fail with
`Access denied: repository … is not configured for this session`. **Don't report
the repo as inaccessible from that alone.** First try the raw HTTP URL directly:
any **public** repo's files are fetchable with `curl` (or `WebFetch`) at
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>`, which works
even when `gh` and the MCP tools don't. (This is how qwt's standalone workflows
were obtained to port them faithfully into the reusable workflows for #44/#45.)
Only fall back to "can't access it" — or to whatever session tooling can add a
repo to scope, if any — after the raw fetch also fails (private repo, or the
network policy blocks the host).

## A canceled review can red-X require-review — don't chase it as a code bug

`claude-code-review.yml`'s `claude-review` job is concurrency-grouped per PR
(`claude-review-<PR>`, `cancel-in-progress: true`) across BOTH the automatic
`pull_request`-triggered review and claude.yml's comment-triggered (`@claude
review`) re-dispatch. When a push and an `@claude review` comment land close
together — or claude.yml's agent run finishes and re-dispatches a review a
minute or two later, landing on top of the next push's auto-review — the two
reviews race and one cancels the other.

The `require-review` gate job asserts `claude-review`'s result is `success`;
a *canceled* run (not skipped) makes that assertion fail, so `require-review`
shows red right after a push even though the surviving review is fine. Before
treating a post-push `require-review` failure as a real problem: check
whether `claude-review`'s conclusion is `cancelled` rather than `failure`. If
so, it's this race, not a code issue — wait for (or re-trigger) an
uncontested review instead of debugging the diff. To avoid causing it: don't
post `@claude review` immediately after pushing a commit on a PR using this
workflow; let the automatic review run alone, or wait for any in-flight
dispatched review to finish first. (See the `claude-review` job's
`concurrency:` comment in `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` for the
full mechanism.)

## Code review guidelines

When reviewing a pull request (e.g. via `/review`, `/code-review`, or as a Claude
PR bot), evaluate the diff against **both** of the following, in addition to
correctness:

### 1. The SERG lab manual

The [UCD-SERG lab manual](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/) is the lab's
authority on coding conventions. Hold changes to its standards, especially:

- [Coding style](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/coding-style.html) —
  object naming, line breaks/formatting, function documentation, comments,
  message/communication style, and Quarto code-reference conventions (backticked
  `pkg::fn()`, markdown package links — no raw HTML in `.qmd`).
- [Coding practices](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/coding-practices.html) —
  function decomposition and length limits, testing requirements, the QA
  checklist, documentation, `{here}` for paths, and tidyverse idioms.
- [Code repositories](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/code-repositories.html) —
  repository organization and version-control practices.

The manual defers to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
for R; prefer tidyverse idioms and the native `|>` pipe.

### 2. d-morrison's review priorities

Above all, code should be **highly modular and idiomatic**:

- **Modular / decomposed.** Favor small, single-purpose functions over long
  monolithic blocks. Flag duplicated logic (DRY), functions that do too much,
  deep nesting, and steps that should be extracted and named. In workflows and
  composite actions, factor shared logic into reusable units rather than copying
  it between files.
- **Idiomatic.** Code should read like the surrounding code and like the
  ecosystem's conventions — idiomatic R (tidyverse), idiomatic YAML/GitHub
  Actions, idiomatic shell. Prefer the standard, well-known way over a clever or
  bespoke one. Match existing naming, structure, and formatting in the file.
- Keep these front-of-mind: surface modularity and idiom issues even when the
  code is otherwise correct.

Be specific and cite the relevant manual section or principle when raising a
point. Distinguish blocking issues from optional suggestions.
