# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## About this repo

Central, reusable GitHub Actions for `d-morrison` / `UCD-SERG` / `ucdavis` R-package
and Quarto repositories (see [`README.md`](README.md)). Each capability ships as a
composite action plus a `workflow_call` reusable workflow. Consumers pin to `@v1`.

### Layout

- Per-capability composite-action directories at the repo root, each with an
  `action.yml` and, for R/Python capabilities, a language-specific helper
  script — e.g. `check-bibliography-dois/` (R), `check-non-standard-chars/` and
  `check-phi/` (Python). `check-links/` bundles `lychee.default.toml`;
  `preview/`, `quarto-publish/`, and `open-sync-pr/` are action-only (the last
  is the shared push-and-open-PR helper used by `bump-submodule` and
  `sync-shared-fragments`).
- `.github/workflows/` — the `workflow_call` reusable workflows that wrap the
  composites (one per consumer-facing capability — the shared internal
  `open-sync-pr` composite has no wrapper), plus the `claude.yml` and
  `claude-code-review.yml` reusable wrappers, and `_selftest.yml`, which
  exercises composites on every PR — local `./` refs for pre-release
  capabilities, and `@v1` through the reusable-workflow wrappers for stable ones.
  `claude-bot.yml` and `claude-review.yml` are event-triggered workflows that run
  the Claude bot in this repo, not `workflow_call` wrappers.
- Several workflows have no corresponding root composite: `check-news.yml`,
  `summary.yml`, and `preview-deploy.yml` are `workflow_call` reusable workflows
  that wrap external actions; `cleanup-pr-previews.yml` is a self-contained
  `workflow_call` reusable workflow (inline shell logic, no external composite);
  `bump-submodule.yml` and `sync-shared-fragments.yml` are `workflow_call`
  reusable workflows that call the shared internal `open-sync-pr` composite;
  `slide-major-tag.yml` is push- and dispatch-triggered and runs only in this
  repo.
- `.github/actions/checkout-submodules/` — a small shared composite reused by the
  reusable workflows.
- `examples/` — caller stubs consumers copy into their own repos.
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — top-level project docs;
  `REVDEPS.md` — lists registered downstream consumer repos. Every PR that
  changes user-facing behavior should add a **changelog fragment** under
  `changelog.d/` (a `<slug>.<category>.md` file — see `changelog.d/README.md`)
  rather than editing `CHANGELOG.md` directly, so parallel PRs never conflict on
  the same `## [Unreleased]` lines. `changelog.d/assemble.sh` collates the
  fragments into `CHANGELOG.md` at release time. This is not CI-enforced
  (`require-changelog.yml` was removed).

When editing a consumer-facing capability, change the composite (`<name>/action.yml`,
plus its helper script if one exists) and keep the wrapping reusable workflow and its
`examples/<name>.yml` stub in sync. Internal-only composites (like `open-sync-pr`)
have no wrapper or example stub to update. New `.github/workflows/` changes are
exercised by `_selftest.yml`; because brand-new actions aren't at the `@v1` tag
yet, the selftest runs them via the local `./<name>` ref until release.

**A brand-new capability that ships at a tag newer than `@v1`** (because `@v1`
was frozen before it existed — see `slide-major-tag.yml` / the Versioning
section of `README.md`) needs its major tag updated at two distinct kinds of
site, not just the obvious one:

1. **Capability-specific refs** — the new capability's own caller stub
   (`examples/<name>.yml`) and reference-page example
   (`website/reference/<name>.qmd`).
2. **Blanket-rule prose** — any general "pin every reference to `@v1`"
   statement elsewhere (`README.md`'s Versioning section,
   `website/workflows.qmd`) needs an exception clause, even though it never
   names the new capability.

Grep the repo for `@v1` rather than relying on memory of where it appears.
Missing either kind surfaces as a workflow-not-found error for consumers who
copy that spot literally (gha#148, caught across two review rounds).

**Adding a new `workflow_call` input to an existing reusable workflow** needs
its own doc sync at three sites beyond the workflow file itself, or the input
is invisible to a consumer skimming the docs:

1. **`README.md`**'s per-workflow table row's "Key inputs" cell.
2. **`website/workflows.qmd`**'s equivalent table row — a separate table, not
   generated from `README.md`, so it drifts independently.
3. **`website/reference/<name>.qmd`**'s Inputs table, plus a commented usage
   line in its `## Example` block.

Grep the repo for the workflow's filename (e.g. `claude-code-review.yml`)
across `README.md`, `website/workflows.qmd`, and `website/reference/` rather
than assuming only one needs the update. Caught across four review rounds on
gha#161 — the fix for round 2's finding (missing composite) surfaced round
3's finding (docs out of sync), whose fix left one more untouched table row
that round 3 flagged as out-of-scope, fixed anyway before round 4 confirmed
clean.

### Tests

`check-phi/tests/test_detectors.py` is a pytest suite pinning each PHI detector's
positive and negative behavior. Run it with `python3 -m pytest check-phi/tests/ -q`;
CI runs it as the `phi-tests` job in `_selftest.yml`. There's no broader unit-test
harness — most capabilities are validated end-to-end by `_selftest.yml`, running
against this repo itself or small throwaway fixtures (stable capabilities via
`@v1`, pre-release ones from local source).

**Generate selftest fixtures at runtime; don't commit them.** A fixture
committed under a composite's `tests/` dir (e.g. a minimal R package for
`test-coverage`) gets swept into OTHER selftest jobs' repo-wide scans: the
`bib` job's dependency resolution tries to treat it as a real package, and the
`phi` job's PHI scanner flags any synthetic identifier in it (a fake
maintainer email, etc.). Generate the fixture in a small script
(`test-coverage/tests/make-fixture.sh` is the pattern) that the `coverage`
selftest job runs before invoking the composite, instead of committing R
package source files (gha#148).

## GitHub access in remote / web sessions

Claude Code on the web (and other remote/CI sessions) runs in a sandbox where the
`gh` and `glab` CLIs are **not installed** and there is no direct GitHub API
access. Skills and built-in commands that tell you to "use `gh`" — `/review`,
`/code-review --comment`, `/security-review`, `/verify`, PR babysitting, PR
creation — only work if their GitHub steps are translated to the GitHub MCP tools
(`mcp__github__*`). When a skill or command instructs a `gh`/`glab` command in
such a session, substitute the equivalent MCP tool below. (In a local session
where `gh` is on `PATH`, use `gh` as the skill describes.)

This repo is `d-morrison/gha`, so MCP calls use `owner: d-morrison`, `repo: gha`.

**Some of these sessions have no local git checkout at all** (not just a missing
`gh` CLI) — there is no working tree to run `git commit`/`git push` against, so
every change (branch, file edit, PR) must go through the MCP write tools below.
Editing a file means: `mcp__github__get_file_contents` first to get its current
blob `sha` (required on every update, not just the first — re-fetch it after
each write since it changes on every commit), then
`mcp__github__create_or_update_file` with the **full** new file content (it
replaces the whole file, there is no patch/diff mode) and that `sha`. A stale
`sha` (from before another commit landed) fails the write — re-fetch and retry
rather than guessing.

| Operation / `gh`/`glab` command | GitHub MCP equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| `gh pr list` | `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` |
| `gh pr view <n>` | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get`) |
| `gh pr diff <n>` | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_diff`) |
| changed files in a PR | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_files`) |
| `gh pr status` / `gh pr checks` | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_status` / `get_check_runs`) |
| `gh pr create` | `mcp__github__create_pull_request` |
| read PR conversation comments | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_comments`) |
| read inline review comments | `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get_review_comments`) — also returns `threadId`s |
| post a top-level PR comment | `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` |
| post inline review comments | `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (`method: create`, no `event`) → `mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review` per comment → `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (`method: submit_pending`) |
| reply to a review comment | `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment` |
| approve / request changes | `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (`method: create` with `event`) |
| resolve a review thread | `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (`method: resolve_thread`, `threadId: <id from get_review_comments>`) |
| `gh issue list` / `gh issue view <n>` | `mcp__github__list_issues` / `mcp__github__issue_read` |
| read a file / repo contents | `mcp__github__get_file_contents` |
| create/edit a file (no local checkout) | `mcp__github__create_or_update_file` — needs the target branch, full new file content, and the file's current blob `sha` (from `get_file_contents`) if it already exists |
| create a branch (no local checkout) | `mcp__github__create_branch` |
| CI runs & job logs | `mcp__github__actions_list`, `mcp__github__actions_get`, `mcp__github__get_job_logs` |
| watch / stop watching PR activity | `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity` / `mcp__github__unsubscribe_pr_activity` |
| `glab mr ...` (GitLab) | N/A — this repo is on GitHub; use the tools above |

Posting inline comments requires a **pending review to already exist** before
`mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review`; create the pending review first, add
each comment, then submit once at the end. Watch and respond to PR activity with
`mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity` / `mcp__github__unsubscribe_pr_activity` (not
`gh pr checks --watch`).

### Reading repos outside the session's MCP scope

A task often needs files from a *sibling* repo (e.g. `d-morrison/qwt`) that the
session's GitHub MCP tools aren't scoped to — those calls fail with
`Access denied: repository … is not configured for this session`. **Don't report
the repo as inaccessible from that alone.** First try the raw HTTP URL directly:
any **public** repo's files are fetchable with `curl` (or `WebFetch`) at
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>`, which works
even when `gh` and the MCP tools don't. (This is how qwt's standalone workflows
were obtained to port them faithfully into the reusable workflows for #44/#45.)
Only fall back to "can't access it" — or to whatever session tooling can add a
repo to scope, if any — after the raw fetch also fails (private repo, or the
network policy blocks the host).

**A 403 from a *rendered* docs site is not the same as the content being
inaccessible.** A GitHub Pages / Quarto-rendered site (e.g.
`ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/coding-style.html`) can reject `WebFetch` (for
reasons unclear — possibly anti-scraping) even though the *source* file it
was built from is a plain file in a public repo. Don't conclude the content is
unreachable — find the source path (often the same repo, e.g.
`coding-style.qmd` for `coding-style.html`, sometimes with `_`-prefixed
included fragments) and raw-fetch that instead using the same
`<path>`-includes-its-extension template above, e.g.
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/coding-style.qmd`.
(Confirmed this way that `ettbc`'s `.lintr.R` predates
`UCD-SERG/lab-manual`'s move to a shared `lms` linter package (source:
[`UCD-SERG/lab-manual/.lintr.R`](https://github.com/UCD-SERG/lab-manual/blob/main/.lintr.R),
which calls `lms::default_linters()` from a package defined in that repo's own
`lms/` subdirectory) — the manual's own docs page 403'd, but its `.qmd`
source and the referenced `.lintr.R` file both fetched cleanly.)

## A canceled review can red-X require-review — don't chase it as a code bug

`claude-code-review.yml`'s `claude-review` job is concurrency-grouped per PR
(`claude-review-<PR>`, `cancel-in-progress: true`) across BOTH the automatic
`pull_request`-triggered review and claude.yml's comment-triggered (`@claude
review`) re-dispatch. When a push and an `@claude review` comment land close
together — or claude.yml's agent run finishes and re-dispatches a review a
minute or two later, landing on top of the next push's auto-review — the two
reviews race and one cancels the other.

The `require-review` gate job asserts `claude-review`'s result is `success`;
a *canceled* run (not skipped) makes that assertion fail, so `require-review`
shows red right after a push even though the surviving review is fine. Before
treating a post-push `require-review` failure as a real problem: check
whether `claude-review`'s conclusion is `cancelled` rather than `failure`. If
so, it's this race, not a code issue — wait for (or re-trigger) an
uncontested review instead of debugging the diff. To avoid causing it: don't
post `@claude review` immediately after pushing a commit on a PR using this
workflow; let the automatic review run alone, or wait for any in-flight
dispatched review to finish first. (See the `claude-review` job's
`concurrency:` comment in `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` for the
full mechanism.)

## Code review guidelines

When reviewing a pull request (e.g. via `/review`, `/code-review`, or as a Claude
PR bot), evaluate the diff against **both** of the following, in addition to
correctness:

### 1. The SERG lab manual

The [UCD-SERG lab manual](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/) is the lab's
authority on coding conventions. Hold changes to its standards, especially:

- [Coding style](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/coding-style.html) —
  object naming, line breaks/formatting, function documentation, comments,
  message/communication style, and Quarto code-reference conventions (backticked
  `pkg::fn()`, markdown package links — no raw HTML in `.qmd`).
- [Coding practices](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/coding-practices.html) —
  function decomposition and length limits, testing requirements, the QA
  checklist, documentation, `{here}` for paths, and tidyverse idioms.
- [Code repositories](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/code-repositories.html) —
  repository organization and version-control practices.

The manual defers to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
for R; prefer tidyverse idioms and the native `|>` pipe.

### 2. d-morrison's review priorities

Above all, code should be **highly modular and idiomatic**:

- **Modular / decomposed.** Favor small, single-purpose functions over long
  monolithic blocks. Flag duplicated logic (DRY), functions that do too much,
  deep nesting, and steps that should be extracted and named. In workflows and
  composite actions, factor shared logic into reusable units rather than copying
  it between files.
- **Idiomatic.** Code should read like the surrounding code and like the
  ecosystem's conventions — idiomatic R (tidyverse), idiomatic YAML/GitHub
  Actions, idiomatic shell. Prefer the standard, well-known way over a clever or
  bespoke one. Match existing naming, structure, and formatting in the file.
- Keep these front-of-mind: surface modularity and idiom issues even when the
  code is otherwise correct.

Be specific and cite the relevant manual section or principle when raising a
point. Distinguish blocking issues from optional suggestions.

### 3. Challenge ambiguous phrasing and terminology

Flag ambiguous terms and phrasing rather than accepting a plausible-sounding
reading — a name that could mean more than one thing, a claim that cites a
value or construct without confirming it exists in the actual code. This is a
global standing rule from the
[`d-morrison/ai-config`](https://github.com/d-morrison/ai-config) corpus.
Ambiguity accepted at face value is how a factually wrong claim (e.g.
documentation citing a nonexistent enum value) slips through review
unchallenged.

### 4. Fact-check prose against domain knowledge and external sources

When a diff touches prose (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `website/`, action
descriptions), assess the accuracy and clarity of its claims — check each
against domain knowledge and, where checkable, an external source (the
referenced tool's own docs, a linked spec) — and check any document-internal
reasoning the prose makes (e.g. a justification for why a workflow does
something a particular way). State which claims are inaccurate, cite the
specific source checked for each judgment, and proactively suggest
additional citations where they'd help. This is a global standing rule from
the [`d-morrison/ai-config`](https://github.com/d-morrison/ai-config) corpus
(`shared/writing/fact-check-prose.md`).
